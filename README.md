Summary: Aggregate queries are frequently used over databases to perform calculations over the dataset. Because this function is being used more and more, methods that would optimize the time of this were explored. By using the census data from the year of 1940 and counting queries generated by the tables from Census Summary File of 2010, 4 different methods were explored. The counting queries were evaluated by running one query at a time in a relational database system, creating one CUBE query that will answer all the workload queries, vectorizing the dataset and the workload queries, and using MapReduce. These 4 methods were used with different sizes of the databases and number of workload queries and were compared to determine which method optimizes the time the most in different conditions.
